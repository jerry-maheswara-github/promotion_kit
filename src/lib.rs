//! # promotion_kit
//!
//! A powerful Rust toolkit for managing dynamic promotions with flexible rules and seamless integration.
//!
//! This crate provides a lightweight and extensible toolkit for managing promotions,

//! digital products, or other service platforms.
//!
//! ---
//! 
//! ## ‚úÖ Features
//!
//! - Define flexible promotions with percentage or fixed amount discounts
//! - Configure minimum transaction amounts, usage limits, and validity periods
//! - Apply promotions and calculate discounts using a clean, composable API
//! - Track usage counts and validate conditions with a minimal rule engine
//!
//! ---
//! 
//! ## ‚ú® Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//!  use promotion_kit::promotion::{Promotion, DiscountType, TargetScope};
//!  use promotion_kit::service::apply_promotion;
//! 
//!  let promo = Promotion {
//!     code: "WELCOME10".into(),
//!     description: "10% off for new users".into(),
//!     discount: DiscountType::Percentage(10.0),
//!     usage_limit: Some(100),
//!     used: 0,
//!     valid_from: 1_700_000_000,
//!     valid_until: 1_800_000_000,
//!     min_transaction: Some(100.0),
//!     target: TargetScope::Global,
//!     currency: Some("IDR".to_string()),
//!  };
//! 
//!  let discount = apply_promotion(&promo, 200.0, 1_750_000_000).unwrap();
//!  assert_eq!(discount, 20.0);
//! ```
